### Markdown Language Basics
Markdown's file format is .md and it's used to make documentation as simple as possible. **If you would like to make changes to this document you must use Markdown.** Luckily that's not hard to do.

You can google search to find resources on Markdown, I personally like referencing this: [Basic Syntax | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Game Mechanic Basics
*The basics of Godot and how to implement normal game mechanics.*

#### Inputs
Luckily Godot has a very simple input manager.

#### Nodes
Godot is entirely node based.

#### Scripts
For this Developer Club - Archive we will only be referencing GDScript as that is our focus.

#### Signals to Scripts 
Scripts can be attached to nodes and nodes can signal to scripts.
